## Python Script to Compare the differences between 2 PDF files
Note this script uses computer vision to compare the differences between the PDFs and expects both PDFs to be identical in terms of formatting and only uses pixel differences between each pages

## How to use

Install all the necessary packages using pip ie opencv, scipy, matplotlib

Set the master and test path in main.py and and the differences between the 2 pdfs will be marked and saved the same file name as the master file.
